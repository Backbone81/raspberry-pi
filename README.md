Raspberry Pi
============
This project is the documentation of my efforts on learning how to control hardware with C/C++. I have multiple decades of
software development experience with different programming languages but never got into low level hardware programming. I
chose the Raspberry Pi for getting some experience with it.

As long as not explicitly stated otherwise, I am using a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ with Raspbian Stretch with Desktop.

This documentation is not meant as an introduction to programming and the Raspberry Pi. I expect the reader to be already familiar
with Windows, Linux, C/C++ and the Raspberry Pi.

**IMPORTANT: The examples and documentations given here are by no means meant to show off best practices. In fact the
code you see here probably falls short on several aspects. It is not intended to be used as general purpose library code
which means it is not very versatile and error checking might be missing to simplify the task. The examples are meant as
proof of concept that demonstrate some mechanics but should not be used in production environments without further
polishing.**
